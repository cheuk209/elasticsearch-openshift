# Acceptance Criteria:
+ Comprehensive understanding of OpenShift EventRouter and Logging Forwarding documentation
+ Confirmation of EventRouter's log forwarding capabilities
+ List of potential gaps or limitations identified


# Output:
+ Summary report of findings
+ List of key features and limitations of EventRouter
+ Recommendations for addressing any identified gaps

Event router is a crucial component in event-driven architecture. 

As cluster admins, we can install logging on our platform cluster, then **forward-logs** to **log-outputs**. You may also visualise log data with Openshift web console, or Kibana.

## Operators
We deploy loggign with operators, which will be responsible for deploying, upgrading, and maintaining logging. 

1. Install Operators
2. Create Clusterlogging custom resource to schedule logging pods
3. Create ClusterLogForwarding custom resource, to define how logs are collected, transformed, forwarded

Openshift elasticsearch log store has NO secure storage for audit logs. Audit logs must be forwarded to the default internal log store, if you want to view in Kibana. 

## Logging architecture
Collector: Daemonset deploys pods to each node, use Vector as recommended by Redshift.

Log store: stores data for analysis. Default output for the log forwarder. 
Options are: Default Lokistack log store, legacy elasticsearch log store, forward logs to other external log stores.

Visualisation: Web console UI 

** For our next task, we would need to figure out our current logging set up, so we would need to have good understanding of possible components. **
